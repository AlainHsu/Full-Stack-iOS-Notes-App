  <summary>Node.js</summary>

> Both your browser JavaScript and Node.js run on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine. This engine takes your JavaScript code and converts it into a faster machine code. Machine code is low-level code which the computer can run without needing to first interpret it.

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

Node.jsâ€™ package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
